Okay, after much burning desire to reactivate my blog, I've finally done it. 

Forget going to the gym. I'm starting the new year with a brand new blog. If you already know me, I used to blog but have since abandoned it. However, my old blog is still [available to browse](https://blog.aisyahrozi.com). May have errors here and there but sufficient enough to glance through the past. 

I'll save the details about the build of this blog for another time. Expect this blog to be a work-in-progress and I'll be adding more features as I add more entries. 

## Anyhoo, what's going in my life? 

Well, I **finally moved to Australia** (since Sept 2023), only not Melbourne as I had dreamed -but Perth, Western Australia as I love the lifestyle here even more. The only bad news about it is that it took a decade to finally found my way here and since covid, as with everything else, the economy is just so expensive. But hey I'm grateful to be here. 

**Our two little girls** are now grown up. They are no longer babies. Sara is now 11 while Amira is 8, (can you imagine??!) They are thriving at school here, doing much better. All that anxiety and worry about them adapting was all for nothing. 

**My mental health:** Doing much better. I've been on a journey to heal the trauma incurred by motherhood (more on that later). Paying for the therapy was the best money I ever spent. Have now been on a journey of healing and finding my way back. I have learned to manage the triggers and compose my act more. 

**Family:** Being away from my family especially my parents is hard. I love them and I miss having them around. The first few months here were horrible for me. Whenever I see a mom figure to me, I would tear up thinking of my mom. Amira especially had a hard time, she started night-walking. That's when I realised the move here was a huge change for her.Luckily, her night-walking eventually stopped and she's doing well now. 

**My hobby:** Last two years I sewed all the outfits for my brother in-law's wedding. For myself, my husband and our two girls and it turned out really well and so proud of the result. I was happy that I 'still got it' despite of being quite out of touch with sewing for a long while. I still haven't gotten my sewing machine here yet but I hope I will soon! 

So for the time being, my current hobby is taking pictures and sometimes making reels of my kids school lunches (yea don't laugh). Yeah, I know sounds a bit ridiculous, tell me about it! 

**Work:** As far as work goes, well, I'm still with Laman7. We have evolved alot as a company and I've grown a lot as employee, manager, and partner. I'm grateful for Laman7 as it has provided and afforded us to move here. It's time to bring it to greater heights, and I know the road ahead is never smooth, but that is the reality of entrepreneurship.
