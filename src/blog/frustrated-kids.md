Kids may throw tantrum when dealing with difficult challenge
Big kids may show frustrations.

What to say:
1. It is hard, because you are doing the right things. Doesn't mean you are doing the wrong things. 
2. It feels hard because IT IS hard. 
3. Yeah, I know, it is tricky isn't it? 
4. Let me know if you need me, I'm here. 

Don't say:
1. thats ok
2. dont sweat it 
3. Are kidding me, it is easy. 

Notes: 
1. Validate their feelings.
2. Their feelings are real. Don't make they sound like they're crazy. 
4. Don't overdo it.
